At the moment, passwords are stored in a simple 
dictionary where each service-password combination is stored 
as a key-value pair. If we want to track when a password was 
added and updated, we'll need to consider alternative data 
structures and learn how to choose between them.

The other tasks will require us to learn more about 
Dictionaries and Lists. For example, if we want to validate 
that a password is unique, we'll have to compare it with all 
the other currently stored passwords.
