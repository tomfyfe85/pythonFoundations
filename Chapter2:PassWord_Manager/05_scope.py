# An Analogy
# Maybe you'd like an analogy at this point. You could compare instance and local variables to local and national newspapers.

# Local variables are like local newspapers in that they're only available, or in scope, within a specific neighbourhood (of the codebase). Instance variables are like national newspapers in that they're available anywhere in the class.

# Note that instance variables are not in scope (available) outside of a class.
