# The password manager will need to:

# Allow a user add new passwords
# Allow a user to view a specific password
# Allow a user to see a list of all the services for which a password has been stored

# will need to take user input
# will need to store passwords in a list
# will need to see in which services a password is stored
  #search by service 
  #key:value pairs
  #service:passWord 

# dictionary -

# person = {
